## Firebase Configuration

### 1. Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Enter project name and complete setup

### 2. Enable Required Services

#### Authentication Setup
1. Select "Authentication" in Firebase Console
2. Click "Get started"
3. Enable "Email/Password" in the "Sign-in method" tab

#### Firestore Setup
1. Select "Firestore Database" in Firebase Console
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (can adjust security rules later)
4. Select database location

### 3. Get Configuration

1. Select "General" tab in project settings
2. Scroll to "Your apps" section
3. Click the web icon `</>`
4. Register the app and copy configuration information

### 4. Security Rules Setup

Set the following security rules in Firestore:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read and write all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Database Indexes Setup

For optimal performance, create the following composite indexes in Firestore:

#### Attendance Collection Indexes
1. **attendance** collection:
   - Fields: `userId` (Ascending), `timestamp` (Ascending)
   - Query scope: Collection

2. **attendance** collection:
   - Fields: `userId` (Ascending), `timestamp` (Descending)
   - Query scope: Collection

#### Leave Requests Collection Indexes
3. **leaveRequests** collection:
   - Fields: `userId` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Descending)
   - Query scope: Collection

4. **leaveRequests** collection:
   - Fields: `status` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Descending)
   - Query scope: Collection

**How to create indexes:**
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
2. Click on "Indexes" tab
3. Click "Add index"
4. Select the collection and add the fields with their sort order
5. Click "Create index"

**Note:** These indexes are essential for efficient querying of attendance records and leave requests. The system will suggest creating these indexes when you first run queries that require them.
